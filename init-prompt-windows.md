I'm trying to build a VS Code extension. It works as expected on macOS where I mount the home directory on the host system to the home directory in a docker container. On windows this is a bit more complex because I need to map the user's home directory in WSL2 to the home directory in the docker container (home/jovyan). So somehow "HOME" in the extension on windows needs to be set to the home directory in WSL2 and NOT the user's home directory on Windows. You and I did try to develop this extension further in WSL2 but kept running into issues that we couldn't figure out.
